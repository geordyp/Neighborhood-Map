# Neighborhood_Map
In this project, I've used API's from Google Maps and Zomato to map out some of my favorite restaurants near where I live. I use Zomato to display reviews for each restaurant and users are able to filter the list of restaurants by type.

* Knockout JS

## Setup
After downloading the project onto your machine there are at least two options for running the web application.

1. Simply open the 'index.html' file in your browser. The application will startup.
2. OR... navigate to the project folder in a terminal and start a server from the directory containing 'index.html'. For example, run `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8080` then navigate to 'localhost:8080' in your browser and the web application will startup.
