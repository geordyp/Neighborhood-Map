# Neighborhood_Map
In this project, I've used API's from Google Maps and Zomato to map out some of
my favorite restaurants near where I live. I use Zomato to display reviews for
each restaurant and users are able to filter the list of restaurants by type.

# Technologies Used
- Knockout JS
- Google Maps API
- Zomato API

# Setup
After downloading the project onto your machine there are at least two options
for running the web application.
1. Simply open the 'index.html' file in your browser. The application will
   startup.
2. OR... navigate to the project folder in a terminal and start a server from
   the directory containing 'index.html'. For example, run
   'python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8080' then navigate to 'localhost:8080' in your
   browser and the web application will startup.
